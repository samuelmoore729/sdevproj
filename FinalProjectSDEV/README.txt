ToDoList by Sam Moore

When first opening the program you will see this page 
The program contains 2 main sections, the To-do list as well as a notes section
for any additional notes the user might want to make note of for their daily tasks.
The notes section is very straight forward, giving the user a text box to contain any
notes they wish to write.

 

The To-do list allows the user to enter the name of a task and a time they wish to complete it, 
and the program will then list it for the user to check the checkbox as they complete their tasks. 
The time must be entered in HH:MM AM/PM format. No other format will be accepted, 
but the user is able to put anything in the “task” section if they wish to. 
The reset button clears all tasks entered. Whenever a task is checked off, the “Tasks Remaining”
 counter at the bottom of the page is updated.
